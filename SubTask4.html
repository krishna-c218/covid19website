        <h1><b>Coronavirus</b></h1>
        <p>
            Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.

Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.

        <h1><b>History</b></h1>
        <p>
            Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn described in 1931 a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness. The chicks' mortality rate was 40–90%. Fred Beaudette and Charles Hudson six years later successfully isolated and cultivated the infectious bronchitis virus which caused the disease. In the 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), were isolated. It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related.

Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s.They were isolated using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States. E.C. Kendall, Malcom Byone, and David Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council in 1960 isolated from a boy a novel common cold virus B814. The virus was not able to be cultivated using standard techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses. In 1965, Tyrrell and Byone successfully cultivated the novel virus by serially passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea. The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn. The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had a lipid envelope. Around the same time, Dorothy Hamre and John Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold virus 229E from medical students, which they grew in kidney tissue culture. The novel virus 229E, like the virus strain B814, when inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether.

        <h2><b>Symptoms of COVID-19</b></h2>
        <p>According to the CDC, people may start to experience symptoms 2–14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a fever</li>
            <li>chills</li>
            <li>a cough</li>
            <li>shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
            <li>sore throat</li>
            <li>congestion or a runny nose</li>
            <li>fatigue</li>
            <li>headache</li>
            <li>muscle pain</li>
            <li>new loss of taste or smell</li>
            <li>nausea or vomiting</li>
            <li>diarrhea</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>According to the CDC, the following groups have a higher risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>people aged 65 years or older</li>
            <li>people living in nursing homes or care facilities</li>
            <li>people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions, including chronic lung disease, serious heart conditions, severe obesity, a compromised immune system, or diabetes</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><b>Precautionary measures for corona pandemic:</b></h1>
        <p>To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
            <li>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.</li>
            <li>Avoid touching your face.
                Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
            <li>Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.</li>
            <li>Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.</li>
        </ul>
